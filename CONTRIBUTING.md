## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: All new code should be written in TypeScript
- **ESLint**: Follow the existing linting rules
- **Formatting**: Use consistent formatting (we recommend Prettier)
- **Comments**: Document complex logic and public APIs

### Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Keep components focused and single-purpose
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully
- **Logging**: Use descriptive console logs for debugging
- **Security**: Never expose sensitive information in logs

### Key Components

- `src/github-app-auth.ts` - GitHub App authentication and installation management
- `src/core-reviewer.ts` - AI review logic (maintain Gemini integration)
- `src/config-manager.ts` - Configuration and credential management
- `src/polling-server.ts` - Polling mode implementation
- `src/webhook-server.ts` - Webhook mode implementation

## üìù Making Changes

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `bugfix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

Examples:
feat(auth): add installation discovery
fix(webhook): handle malformed payloads
docs(setup): update GitHub App instructions
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   - Write clear, focused commits
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test Changes**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run lint  # if available
   # Test manually with a test repository
   ```

4. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Link any related issues
   - Request review from maintainers

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Set up a test repository** with sample PRs
2. **Install your test GitHub App** on the repository
3. **Test both polling and webhook modes**
4. **Verify AI reviews** are generated correctly
5. **Check error handling** with invalid configurations

### Test Cases

- [ ] New PR creation triggers review
- [ ] PR updates trigger new reviews
- [ ] Draft PRs are skipped
- [ ] Large files are handled appropriately
- [ ] API rate limits are respected
- [ ] Webhook signature verification works
- [ ] Installation permissions are checked

## üêõ Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports

Please include:
- **Environment**: Node.js version, OS, deployment method
- **Configuration**: Redacted configuration details
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear reproduction steps
- **Expected vs Actual**: What should happen vs what actually happens
- **Logs**: Relevant log output (remove sensitive information)

### Feature Requests

Please include:
- **Use Case**: Why is this feature needed?
